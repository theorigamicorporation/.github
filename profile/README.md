## Welcome!

The Origami Corporation was founded in 2015 in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, with a focus on three core areas: hosting, software development, and cybersecurity. Since our inception, we have steadily expanded our team with highly motivated professionals who possess a deep technical understanding and passion for implementing innovative technologies. Our management team's extensive technical background, combined with Bulgaria's position as a leader in the Eastern European IT sector, has provided fertile ground for growth and success.

**Our WHY:** create a new standard in IT product and IT service delivery quality.

**Our HOW:** by building a team of hardworking technology loving professionals.

**Our WHAT:** software development domain, cyber security domain and hosting domain.

## What We Do

- **Custom Software Developmen**t: Let us bring your project vision to life with our expertise in web development, mobile applications, and enterprise systems.

- **Cloud Consulting and Hosting**: We'll help you navigate the world of cloud computing, ensuring a seamless migration and optimal cloud strategy.

- **DevOps and Automation**: Streamline your development processes and boost efficiency with our DevOps and automation services.

- **Security and Compliance**: Protect your critical assets and meet regulatory standards with our comprehensive security assessments, compliance consulting, and secure development practices.

- **Data Analytics and AI**: Unlock the power of your data and drive informed decisions with our expertise in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence solutions.

We know that different organizations have different workflows, this is why we have designed five customizable business models to integrate seamlessly in your day-to-day operation.

• Project-based Work: Pretty straight-forward model – you give us project requirements, we estimate time/cost, you approve and then we start to work on it.

• Dedicated G.U.Y.: We discuss your project, recommend a G.U.Y. with a certain skillset and we proceed with an offer and a contract for the time you will need him/them to work in your team.

• Hourly G.U.Y.: You tell us that you will need N hours from a G.U.Y. with a certain skillset. We make an offer and then proceed with a contract. There can actually be more than one professional working on the committed hours on your project.

• First Response G.U.Y.: We dedicate a G.U.Y. that will act as immediate line of defense on a monthly/annually subscription and whenever an incident happens with your website/software/security, he/they will be there to help mitigate the disaster.

• Long Term Partnership: This is our latest model which certain start-ups have already requested – it is the most inexpensive one of all, but we will request to become shareholders on your project/company and have control over the technical decisions. It is more like owning the technical part of your project so you can focus on business/sales. We are open for investing options if your projects are appealing. Each model has its own pros and cons and each client can pick the one (or more) that best suits their business needs.
